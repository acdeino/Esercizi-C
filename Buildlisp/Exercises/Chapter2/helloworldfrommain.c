//  Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in C programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop. A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except the fact that it is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
/* do {
   statement(s);
} while( condition ); */

//A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.

// break; statement breaks the inner loop it is written into, interrupts command. Can be used for switch statement as well

// continue; is kinda like break; instead of interrupting the loop, it forces the next iteration of the loop to take place, skipping any code in between


// typedef allows to explictly define new names for data types
